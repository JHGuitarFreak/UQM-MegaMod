To build The Ur-Quan Masters, you need at least the following software:

For unix-like platforms (such as Linux, BSD, Solaris, MinGW):
GCC 3.0 - GNU C Compiler
	http://gcc.gnu.org/
	Debian package: gcc

GNU Make 3.80
	ftp://ftp.gnu.org/
	Debian package: make

For Windows:
Microsoft Visual C++ 6 or newer (or MinGW+MSYS, see INSTALL.mingw for that)
Visual C++ 6.0 Processor Pack (if using VC6, to build MMX-accelerated code)
	http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/downloads/tools/ppack/

For Mac OS X:
Apple Developer Tools (for Mac OS X 10.2 and older)
	http://connect.apple.com/
Xcode Tools (for Mac OS X 10.3)
	http://developer.apple.com/tools/macosxtools.html

Additionally, The Ur-Quan Masters requires the following libraries:
Note that dependencies can differ between different OS's.

OpenGL v1.2 (if HAVE_OPENGL is defined, which is the default)
    Win32 users should have all by default, following is for Linux version:
	http://www.xfree86.org/
	Debian package: xlibmesa-dev OR nvidia-glx OR <vendor specific>
	XFree86 4.x comes with Mesa, which is a clone.
	Note: Mesa is a software emulation. For enjoyable results
	you will need hardware accelerated OpenGL (GLX).
	These usually conflict with mesa (can result in X server crash).

SDL v1.2
	The Simple Direct-Media Layer
	A fairly good multiplatform low level graphics library.
	Homepage: www.libsdl.org
	Download: http://www.libsdl.org/download-1.2.php
	Debian package: libsdl1.2-dev (and various runtime debs)

SDL_image
	An image loading library used with SDL.
	Homepage: http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/
	Download: http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/release/
	Debian packages: libsdl-image1.2 libsdl-image1.2-dev
	
OpenAL (optional)
	A cross-platform spatialized audio library.
	Homepage: http://www.openal.org/
	Windows SDK download: http://connect.creativelabs.com/openal/Downloads/OpenAL11CoreSDK.zip
    Debian package: libopenal-dev

libogg and libvorbis (optional but highly recommended)
	Audio codec to play Ogg Vorbis files, used for music and speech.
	Homepage: http://www.xiph.org/ogg/vorbis/index.html
	Download:
	    For Windows:
			SDK download: http://www.vorbis.com/files/1.0.1/windows/OggVorbis-win32sdk-1.0.1.zip
	    For Linux:
			http://www.xiph.org/downloads/
			download libogg and libvorbis.
            Debian Packages: libogg-dev libvorbis-dev

Tremor (alternative for libogg and libvorbis)
	Audio codec to play Ogg Vorbis files, used for music and speech.
	This library avoids floating point math and should be used instead
	of libogg and libvorbis when floating point support is not available
	or slow (on some handhelds and game consoles).
	Homepage: http://www.xiph.org/vorbis/
	Download: http://svn.xiph.org/trunk/Tremor (Subversion)

Libmikmod (also included with UQM source)
	Audio codec to play .mod files, used for the original PC music.
	Homepage: http://mikmod.raphnet.net/
	Download: https://sourceforge.net/projects/mikmod/files/
    Debian package: libmikmod-dev

Zlib v1.2
	Data compression / decompression library

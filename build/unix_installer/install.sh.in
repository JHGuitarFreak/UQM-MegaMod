-== The Ur-Quan Masters installation ==-

Hi, I'm your friendly neighbourhood installation program.
I will make you very happy, but first, we've got some business to take
care of.

I can't find a good pager. I need one. Sorry. Here's your prompt back.

	cat << EOF
I need 'unzip' for unzipping things. You don't seem to have it.
That means no unzipping for me. And no The Ur-Quan Masters for you.
And that's really not acceptable, is it? So I hope you'll install it
soon. That way we'll both be happy.

Now I need somewhere to put all those Ur-Quan Masters files.
My invisible friend tells me $INPUT_install_prefix_DEFAULT is a good place.
I would put an executable there in a bin/ dir and a lot of junk together
in a subdir under share/ and a little bit in a subdir under lib/
But you're the boss, so where shall I put them?"

There's no such directory. If you want me to stuff it all in /dev/null,
just say so. No need to toy with me.
Then again, I could create that directory for you.

Erm... I mean 'permission denied'. Sorry about that.
I guess we'll need to find another place.

Ok, I've created that dir for you, even though it isn't in my job
description. Now let's get on with the copying.

Ooh, a very fine place indeed. Unfortunately it's not your fine place.
You can't write there, and for some strange cosmological coincidence,
neither can I. I think we need another place."

Ok, I'm ready now to start filling your hard drive.
It might take some time though, so don't hold your breath.
On second thought, DO hold your breath, I like the colour blue.
Orange too, for that matter, but I don't think you can manage that.

All done. Now you can play The Ur-Quan masters.
I told you I was going to make you very happy.
And if you're looking for documentation, you can find some in
${PREFIX}share/uqm-megamod/doc/. If you aren't looking for documentation, too.
But feel free to delete them. You know where to find them.

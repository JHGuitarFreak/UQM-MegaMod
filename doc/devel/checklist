                    -== Checklist for releases ==-


Preparing for the release:
- update the 'version' file in the content dir
- update 'uqmversion.h'
- update uqm.lsm (needs to be done after the content packages are generated)
- test on all relevant platforms

  - generate Whatsnew from the ChangeLog
  - doc/users/manual.txt

Building the release:
- make a final build in release mode
- for the source archive:

    Just using 'svn update' and watching the output will not be
    enough, as the files not in repository will be ignored.
  - be sure to include content/version
- Building the content packages:
  - make sure the permissions in the .zip files are ok (0644 for data files
    and 0755 for executables and dirs)
  - don't compress .ogg files

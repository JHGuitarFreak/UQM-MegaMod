The file src/sc2code/uqmdebug.c and src/sc2code/uqmdebug.h contain various
debugging functions, which are included in the binary when the game
is built in debug mode.
These functions can be called from anywhere in the code, though some
require the game to be in a specific state.
The function debugKeyPressed() in uqmdebug.c is called when the debug key
is pressed. This function is a suitable place to put various debugging
calls.
There are also global variables 'debugHook' and 'doInputDebugHook',
which can be set to a function to be called from the Starcon2Main thread.
If if is set, 'debugHook' is called the next iteration of the main game loop
(which will occur when the current activity (IP, HyperSpace, Communication,
Battle) changes. The game will be in a well defined state here.
If 'doInputDebugHook' is set, the function it is set to is called from
doInput(), which is called all throughout the game.
By setting one of these hooks, a function can be called from the Starcon2Main
thread, thereby eliminating threading issues that may otherwise arrise.
The debug key can be specified in user's override.cfg by adding a line
with a text similar to "debug.1 = STRING:key F12".
An interactive way to access various debugging code, similar to
the uio debug mode (see below) is in the works.

The most interesting debugging functionality available at the moment is
listed below:
- the function equipShip()
  When this function is called, the SIS is equiped with various useful
  modules (a possible Precursor Bomb is left in place), all
  fuel tanks and crew pods are filled to the maximum, you are given
  the maximum number of landers, and all possible lander shields are
  installed.
- the boolean variable instantMove
  When this variable is set to TRUE, you can select a location on the
  star map, and your HyperSpace/Quasispace coordinates will immediately
  be set to them. Your realspace coordinates are not changed, so if you
  are exploring a solar system, you'll only notice it when you leave to
  HyperSpace.
- the function showSpheres()
  When this function is called, all spheres of influence of the active
  races will be shown.
- the function activateAllShips()
  When this function is called, it will make all ships available for
  purchase in the shipyard.
- the function forwardToNextEvent()
  Fast forwards the clock until the next event. If TRUE is given as an
  argument, the HYPERSPACE_ENCOUNTER_EVENTs, which normally happen every
  day, are skipped.
- the function dumpEvents()
  Outputs information on all scheduled events to a FILE.
- the function dumpPlanetTypes()
  Outputs information on all planet types to a FILE.
- the function dumpUniverseToFile()
  Outputs information on the universe to "./PlanetInfo". This function
  should only be called from debugHook, as threading issues would otherwise
  arrise.
- the functions resetCrewBattle() and resetEnergyBattle()
  This function, when called in melee, sets the current crew or energy
  level of the bottom player's ship to its maximum. This works both in
  Supermelee and in the full game.
- the function uio_debugInteractive()
  This function is not defined in sc2code/uqmdebug.h, but in libs/uio.h.
  This function can interactively (tty-based) display information on
  the state of the uio file system, and modifications can be made.
- the function luaUqm_debug_run()
  This function is not defined in sc2code/uqmdebug.h, but in
  uqm/lua/luadebug.c
  This function can be used to interactively (tty-based) execute Lua
  commands. Put 'return' in front of an expression to show its result.
  Press CTRL-D to exit (on *nix; probably CTRL-Z on Windows).
- the function dumpStrings()
  This function prints all the game strings, and is useful to check whether
  the various string bases, as defined in gamestr.h, are correct.
- the function debugContexts()
  Prints and visually displays the various graphics contexts.
  This function should only be called from doInputDebugHook(), as threading
  issues would otherwise arrise.
